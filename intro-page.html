  <h1> Inclusive Design </h1>
  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p> Have you ever heard of the term "inclusive design" and what do you think it means?
    Inclusive design is design that considers the diversity of all humans including as many 
    people as possible with respect to one's capabilities, gender, age, religion, language,
    and other forms of human differences. The importance of inclusive design is to raise equality
    and allow everyone to access and use certain devices, software, tools, objects, and etc that they
    couldnâ€™t previously use or perform before. It is crucial that there is inclusion for everyone and 
    everything that we do because everyone has the right to be open to new opportunities and to do 
    things the same way as everyone just like how every student from kindergarten to highschool
    has the right to a free public education. The purpose of this OER is to inform you of what
    inclusive design is all about and the importance of it and to get you thinking more "inclusively". </p>
