## Introduction ##

Have you ever heard of the term "inclusive design" and what do you think it means? Inclusive design is design that considers the diversity of all humans including as many people as possible with respect to one's capabilities, gender, age, religion, language, and other forms of human differences. The importance of inclusive design is to raise equality and allow everyone to access and use certain devices, software, tools, objects, and etc that they couldnâ€™t previously use or perform before. In this generation, it is crucial that there is inclusion for everyone and everything that we do because everyone has the right to be open to new opportunities and to do things the same way as everyone just like how every student from kindergarten to highschool has the right to a free public education.
