        <h2>Recognize Diversity and Uniqueness</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone is unique and everyone is different. When designing for literally everyone, rather than the mythical average, it is important to keep these difference in mind to prevent complications. While it is impossible to fully address every need it is possible to address many needs. To create a solution that keeps everyone’s best interests at heart the one-size-fits-all idea must be forgone for the one-size-fits-one ideal. With current capabilities of modern technology, flexible and adaptable systems can be created to meet this ideal.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Usage of Inclusive Process and Tools</h2>
        <p>
          A team has a large variety of people with different views and skill sets. The benefits is that people with different opinions will challenge one another and polish the ideas; resulting in more comprehensive incident prediction and mitigation, and efficient models. This group of people should also include the target market of the product or service as contributors rather than just users.
          Inclusive tools mean tools that allow a multitude of different people to work. For example, usability testing, a technique used to determine the usability of a service through testing with a potential user. The users findings are then reported to the development team to create improvements.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Broader Beneficial Impact</h2>
        <p>
          By acknowledging that everything is interconnected, inclusive design aims to trigger a virtuous cycle of inclusion. Inclusive designers are responsible to strive towards making a larger impact beyond the intended beneficiary of the design. For this to happen, inclusive design must be integrated into design in general. This is known as the “curb-cut effect”. Curb cuts, for example, were designed for disabled veterans. However, it helps everyone; people in wheelchairs, people with strollers, cyclists, pedestrians using a walker or cane and so forth. When designing inclusively, a broad beneficial impact should be strived for.
