        <p>
          Rather than attempting to fit every human under the sun in the same box with minimal stretching capabilities, one size fits one tailors every box to one personâ€™s specific needs. Everyone is different, a mix of different desires, capabilities and backgrounds. This means what people look for is different and while the popular design may satisfy most people, it does not satisfy everyone. In school, a student who is fidgeting, whether it is due to sugar and caffeine, excitement due to an upcoming event or due to their disposition as a kinesthetic learner, are at a disadvantage since they are distracted. The school system was made for students to read and listen at their desks for hours on end and does not provide time for students to resolve or cope with any distractions.
          Accessibility issues may arise due to happenstance or setting as well. Such as watching a video in a library but with no headphones or watching a video but with broken speakers. The information in the video is now inaccessible because there is no way to hear the audio. <br><br>
          With modern technology it is possible to create a flexible system that can adapt to different people in different situations. A person with trouble reading small letters can increase the font size rather than grabbing a magnify glass. People with aphantasia, inability to conjure up mental images, will have virtual 3D models they may play around with. Students can find and access lessons after school should they have been distracted during class or even find additional resources they feel better explain the material and share it with other students. Videos can have captions which the viewer could obtain information from without audio.
          Technology can offer and create multiple methods to learn, connect or share on one platform. Having one platform rather than separate ones is important because it dissuades negative segregation and provides the same resources for everyone.
