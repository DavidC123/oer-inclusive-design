  <h2> Noncommercial Images </h2>
   <p>Noncommercial open for the public to use, whether it is on their website, or their blog,
    or just in general. It’s easy to find an image on the internet, but you need to know how to find an image that is available for you to use.
     There are multiple ways to do this but many find that there are two easy ways. First, there is the Google Images way:     
  <ol> 
    <li> Go to <a href="https://images.google.com/">Google images</a> and type your search term into the search bar. Press Enter.</li>
    <li> You will find many images that relate to your search term, but these images may have licenses. To find ones that don’t,
      go to the ‘search tools’ button, which is right below the search bar.</li>
    <li>It will automatically be set to ‘Not filtered by license’. There are also many other options that come with it.
      For one that means you may use it for whatever purpose, click “Labeled for reuse" Then you may find an image that suits your needs. </li>
  </ol>
  <p> The second method is searching through Flickr: </p>
  <ol> 
    <li> Go to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr main page</a> </li>
    <li> Search in the toolbar for your desired image </li>
    <li> Click on the “Any license” option near the top left of the screen and a list will appear of the different image licenses </li>
    <li> Select the “No known copyright restriction” option and the list of non commercial images for you to use legally will appear. </li>
  </ol>
