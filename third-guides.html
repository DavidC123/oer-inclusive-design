  <h1> Inclusive Guides </h1>
 
  <h2> Noncommercial Images </h2>
   <p>Noncommercial images are images that are open for the public to use, whether it is on their website, or their blog,
     or just in general. It’s easy to find an image on the internet, but you need to know how to find an image that is available
     for you to use. There are multiple ways to do this but many find that there are two easy ways.
     First, there is the Google Images way: </p>     
  <ol> 
    <li> Go to <a href="https://images.google.com/">Google images</a> and type your search term into the search bar. Press Enter.</li>
    <li> You will find many images that relate to your search term, but these images may have licenses. To find ones that don’t,
      go to the ‘search tools’ button, which is right below the search bar.</li>
    <li>It will automatically be set to ‘Not filtered by license’. There are also many other options that come with it.
      For one that means you may use it for whatever purpose, click “Labeled for reuse" Then you may find an image that suits your needs. </li>
  </ol>
  <p> The second method is searching through Flickr: </p>
  <ol> 
    <li> Go to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr main page</a> </li>
    <li> Search in the toolbar for your desired image </li>
    <li> Click on the “Any license” option near the top left of the screen and a list will appear of the different image licenses </li>
    <li> Select the “No known copyright restriction” option and the list of non commercial images for you to use legally will appear. </li>
  </ol>
  <h2> Inclusive Document </h2>
<p> To make a document more inclusive, you can follow the IDRC <a href="http://adod.idrc.ocad.ca/">ADOD guide</a>, which
  will make your document much more user friendly and accessible. This ADOD guide shows and provides you with pretty much all the 
  different types of documents and tips on how they can be much more inclusive and accessible for the users.
  What it means to make a document more user friendly is making it more engaging, appealing, and well structured for the user 
  to better navigate and catch the attention of the user. What it means to make a document more accessible is making it in a way
  that as much people as possible can access and understand your document, examples of this is a alternative text option and making
  content more easy to understand. </p>
  
  <h2> Alternative text </h2>
  <p> An alternative text is a description of the image detailing and giving a literal definition of what pictures
    and images are showing and portraying so that people who are visually impaired can understand them and if the image
    fails to load for the user. </p>
  <p> To give an alternative text description of images: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> You have to first look at what the image is trying to portray to you. </li>
    <li> Give a literal and an as detailed as you can description for the image using the most appropriate and least amount of words you can. </li>
    <li> By looking at the alternative text description you should be able to visualize what the image may look like and maybe the message that it is trying to give to you. </li>
  </ol>
  <p> Here are some examples of non commercial images with alternative text; </p>
