  <h1> Inclusive Design </h1>
  <h2> Introduction </h2>
     <p> Have you ever heard of the term "inclusive design" and what do you think it means?</p>
     <p> Inclusive design is design that considers the diversity of all humans including as many </p>
     <p> people as possible with respect to one's capabilities, gender, age, religion, language,</p>
     <p> and other forms of human differences. The importance of inclusive design is to raise equality</p>
     <p> and allow everyone to access and use certain devices, software, tools, objects, and etc that they</p>
     <p> couldnâ€™t previously use or perform before. It is crucial that there is inclusion for everyone and </p>
      <p>everything that we do because everyone has the right to be open to new opportunities and to do </p>
      <p>things the same way as everyone just like how every student from kindergarten to highschool</p>
     <p> has the right to a free public education. The purpose of this OER is to inform you of what</p>
     <p> inclusive design is all about and the importance of it and to get you thinking more "inclusively". </p>
