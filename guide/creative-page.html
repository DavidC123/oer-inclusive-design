      <h1>creative commons</h1>

      <p>
        Creative Commons (sometimes referred to as CC) is a nonprofit organization that enables people to both find and share content legally. Free CC licenses are issued. The license enables the free distribution of content and allows creators to share their work to the public while still reserving their own rights. There are standardized terms for users to follow. Creative Commons’ work extend past just the license and even offer other tools such as CC0, a public domain. They also have, Public Domain Mark, a tool for creating works in the public domain.
        There are three “layers” of licenses the first layer is the Commons Deed, which is understandable by normal people. Then it is followed by the second layer known as the Legal Code. The final layer uses a software known as CC Rights Expression Language (CC REL) to ensure that it is “machine readable”. Over all the license becomes more than just a legal concept but becomes something understood by all.

      <h2>applying a CC license</h2>
      <p>To apply a CC license for online material:
        Choose your license. In the ‘License Features’ box, checking all the boxes that apply.
        Then, look in the ‘Selected Licence’ box, and the subtitle will read what kind of license you have chosen.
        Follow the instructions, and copy the HTML code into your webpage.

        To apply a CC license for offline material or third-party platforms without built-in Creative Commons capabilities:
        Choose your license, then mark your work with the following text:
        “This work is licensed under the Creative Commons [insert description] License. To view a copy of the license, visit [insert url]”

        Please note that many media platforms (such as Flickr, YouTube, SoundCloud) have built-in Creative Commons capabilities, letting users mark their material with a CC license through their account settings.
      </p>
      <h2>Seeing if others have used a CC license</h2>
      <p>The license information is usually placed in the footer. Otherwise, you may have to contact the owner to ask about their Creative Commons site. Most third-party platform, have a built-in Creative Commons license.
